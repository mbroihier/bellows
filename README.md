I have added a command of my own called script which starts a background script that turns on a ZibBee controlled light at sundown and turns it off 45 minutes later.  It also starts a simple web server that allows the user to turn on or off any light in the ZigBee network.  The web page displayed by the server has been specifically crafted for my particular test network.

This is a prototype for a future project.
